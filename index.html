					<h1>THE FIRST DAY I VISITED SHOPRITE</h1>
					<hr>
					<p>The first day I went to Shoprite. Was first of January 2015 .MY Dad said we were going to Shoprite, I wore polo and trouser, we used Lexus to go to Shoprite. we were 3 in the car. I saw some security men  WEARING  UNIFORM  in the gate. MY  dad said he wants to redraw money  from  the bank. there were so many cars when I came out of the car in the parking lot. when I went in, I  told my mum I want to ride a horse and  she allowed when I  finished. <br><br>
	
We went to game and we bought meat pie, doughnut and pizza .WE BOUGHT  SO  MANY  THINGS , SO we went to play  games after that. we went to barb my  hair  which my  hair  was bushy that day and it Took 4minuetes.<br><br>
When they finished barbing my hair. My dad said lets go to the seminars to watch a movie and it took 2hours. when we finished I was so hungry so they bought rice and chicken and I enjoyed myself.<br><br>
THEN  MY MUM SAID THAT SHE WANT TO BUY SOME CLOTHES FOR ME AND SHE WHAT I DINâ€™T EXPECT AND MY DAD SAID THAT IT IS TIME TO GO THAT  HE IS TIERED SO AS WE WERE GOING MY MUM SAID SHE WAS THIRSTY SO MY  DAD BOUGHT WATER FOR HER.<br><br>
